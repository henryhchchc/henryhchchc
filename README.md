👋 Hi there!

I am an incoming postdoctoral researcher at [CISPA Helmhomtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). I completed my PhD studies at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk).
I work on [software engineering research](https://scholar.henryhc.net) — I write code to analyze and test other code.

I program in Rust, Python, and Kotlin.
